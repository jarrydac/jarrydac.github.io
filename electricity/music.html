                Were gonna turn it off,  <br/>
                $25,000 down the drain,  <br/>
                Theyre gonna rip us off  <br/>
                Taking our money right behind our back  <br/>
                And were leaving on our lights at night  <br/>
                Because we forget  <br/>
                And the figures will keep goin’ up because we do nothing,  <br/>
                And the message coming from our class  <br/>
                Says turn off the lights  <br/>
                (Music plays)  <br/>
                Don’t wanna pay for it,  <br/>
                Every single room has a conditioner,  <br/>
                Everyone uses it,  <br/>
                Without even knowing the financial cost  <br/>
                And we can’t forget about God’s good vision,  <br/>
                For a clean planet,  <br/>
                And that is we need to do  <br/>
                But we don’t at all  <br/>
                And the message coming from Ms Bagh says save the world.  <br/>
                (Music plays)
